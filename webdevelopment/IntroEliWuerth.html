    Hello, my name is Eli Wuerth.
    I am a senior in information technology. I was born in Indiana. There I lived with my parents, and my two older brothers. During my senior year of high school, I decided to visit Mizzous campus. Immediately I fell in love with it. I am loving life in Missouri right now. Missouri seems like Indiana but is a breath of fresh air. I came into Mizzou as a computer science major. After my freshman year, I switched my major to information technology. I switched my major because I realized It was what I really wanted to do. I am obtaining three information technology certificates. I plan to pursue a career in information technology. I am applying for jobs, hoping to get some experience in the information technology field. More precisely I'm looking to work in either the graphic design or web development fields. One of the top companies I would like to work for is Mastercard. My dream is to work somewhere where the weather is warm year round. Someday I would love to start my own design business, designing web applications and graphics for media.
