        <!-- Intro Paragraph -->
        <p class="paragraph">My website is an online space where I show off what I've done and learned. It's not just a boring resume; it's a cool place that gives hiring folks a real look into my school and work experiences. The main idea is to go beyond the basics and let
            people know the details of my projects and experiences. I want this site to always be updated with the latest info on my education, achievements, and ongoing projects. It's a way to stand out when I'm applying for jobs. Come check out my story,
            and let's connect!</p>
