                <h3>Project 1: Hangman</h3>
                <p><b>Hangman Description</b></p>
                <p>The GroupP-FinalProject is a Java-based Hangman game that allows users to guess letters in words from various categories, including college majors, places, fictional characters, food, and companies. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Swing and retrieves words from a JSON database. In this project, I served as a developer responsible for designing and implementing the core functionalities of the Hangman game, with primary tasks including developing the game logic, creating the GUI, and integrating the word database, as well as contributing to testing and debugging to ensure a smooth user experience. The outcome was a fully functional Hangman game that provides an engaging and interactive experience for users, successfully tracking guesses, displaying the current state of the word, and informing users when they win or lose. The project was well-received, demonstrating effective collaboration and technical execution. I utilized several tools and methodologies, including Java as the primary programming language, Swing for the GUI, Maven for managing project dependencies, Gson for reading the word database, and JUnit/TestNG for testing. This experience enhanced my skills in Java programming, particularly in object-oriented programming and GUI development, as well as software design, version control using Git, and understanding software testing methodologies, all of which will be beneficial in my future endeavors.</p>
                <p><b>Hangman Tools and Methodologies</b></p>
                <p>In the development of the Hangman game, I utilized several tools and methodologies to ensure a successful outcome. The primary programming language used was Java, which allowed for efficient object-oriented programming and GUI development. For the graphical user interface, I employed Swing, a powerful library for creating interactive applications. Maven was used for managing project dependencies, ensuring that all necessary libraries were included and up to date. To read the word database, I utilized Gson, a library for converting Java objects to JSON and vice versa. Testing was conducted using JUnit/TestNG, which provided a robust framework for unit testing and ensuring the reliability of the code. Additionally, version control was managed through Git, allowing for effective collaboration and tracking of changes throughout the development process.</p>
                <p><b>Hangman Skills and Experience</b></p>
                <p>Through the development of the Hangman game, I gained valuable skills and experience that will be beneficial in my future endeavors. I enhanced my proficiency in Java programming, particularly in object-oriented design principles and GUI development using Swing. The project also provided me with hands-on experience in software design methodologies, including version control with Git, which is essential for collaborative development. Additionally, I improved my understanding of software testing methodologies through the use of JUnit/TestNG, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the code. Overall, this project solidified my passion for software development and provided a strong foundation for future projects.</p>
                <p><b>Hangman Challenges and Solutions</b></p>
                <p>During the development of the Hangman game, I encountered several challenges that required creative problem-solving and collaboration with my team. One of the primary challenges was integrating the word database with the game logic, as ensuring seamless communication between the two components was crucial for a smooth user experience. To address this, I implemented a robust data retrieval system using Gson to read the JSON database efficiently. Another challenge was designing an intuitive and visually appealing GUI that would enhance user engagement. I conducted user testing and gathered feedback to refine the interface, ensuring it was user-friendly and met the project's goals. Additionally, debugging and testing were ongoing challenges, but by utilizing JUnit/TestNG, I was able to identify and resolve issues effectively, leading to a polished final product.</p>
                <p><b>Project Outcome</b></p>
                <p>The Hangman game was a resounding success, providing an engaging and interactive experience for users. The game effectively tracked guesses, displayed the current state of the word, and informed users when they won or lost. The project demonstrated effective collaboration and technical execution, with all team members contributing to the successful outcome. The positive feedback received from users highlighted the game's enjoyable gameplay and user-friendly interface. Overall, the project achieved its goals and provided a valuable learning experience for all team members involved.</p>
                <p><b>Hangman Future Improvements</b></p>
                <p>Looking ahead, there are several potential improvements that could enhance the Hangman game further. One area for improvement is expanding the word database to include a wider variety of categories and difficulty levels, providing users with more options and challenges. Additionally, implementing a scoring system could add a competitive element to the game, allowing users to track their performance over time. Enhancing the GUI with animations and sound effects could also improve user engagement and create a more immersive experience. Finally, considering the implementation of multiplayer functionality would allow users to compete against friends or family, adding a social aspect to the game. These improvements would not only enhance the user experience but also provide opportunities for further learning and development in software design and programming.</p>
